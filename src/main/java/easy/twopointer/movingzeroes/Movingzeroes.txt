intialise both fast & slowpointer to zero

traverse through the array using fast pointer
add a if cdn for fast pointer to check if current element is non zero
if non zero swap arr[fast] & arr [slow]
fast pointer will be increasing despite the if or else condition
slow pointer will move only when the if cdn of non zero element is satisfied
